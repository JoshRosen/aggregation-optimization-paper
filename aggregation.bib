abstract = {A technique is proposed to prevent the return of infrequently used items to cache after they are bumped from it. Simulations have shown that the return of these items, called cache pollution, typically degrade cache-based system performance (average reference time) by 10\% to 30\%. The technique proposed involves the use of hardware called a bypass-cache, which, under program control, will determine whether each reference should be through the cache or should bypass the cache and reference main memory directly. Several inexpensive heuristics for the compiler to determine how to make each reference are given. It is shown that much of the performance loss can be regained},

- Give me an example of a join query that can benefit from partial pre-aggregation.  Answer: a group-by applied to a join query; we can perform some of the grouping on one of the join inputs first, then join and perform the remainder of the grouping later.
        
- Walk through the math for computing the absorption rate; sketch the derivation and proofs for me.
        
- How can this be applied to sort-merge join?
                  
General Notes        
        
It's interesting that their experiements never showed a case where exact pre-aggregation harmed performance.
        
Actually, query U3 in Table 2 describes a case where the additional hash lookups from partial pre-aggregation were prohibitively expensive and made the query take longer.},
