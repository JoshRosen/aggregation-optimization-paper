# Aggregation Optimization Notes

This repository contains some notes / scraps from an unfinished aggregation
optimization project that I worked on while in grad school.


[Click here for a rendered PDF of the work-in-progress writeup](http://latex.aslushnikov.com/compile?git=https://github.com/JoshRosen/aggregation-optimization-paper&target=aggregation_review.tex).

The `akka-prototype` directory contains some code for playing around with
different aggregation pipelines / topologies.
